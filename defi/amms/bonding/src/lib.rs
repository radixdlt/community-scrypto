//! scrypto-bonding: A Scrypto package for creating and using bonding curves as an automated market maker on Radix
//!
//! The main blueprint to interact with is `BondingAMM`.  It has buy/sell functionality against a single
//! bonding curve defined by a plugable second component.  It will instantiate a component from the `RatioBondingCurve`
//! blueprint if no other curve component is provided.
//!
//! There is also an extrememly simple `BasicBondingCurve` blueprint (more like a flat line) which could be used to implement
//! a simple "wrapped" or "virtual" token from another.  Or it's a a good template for making your own curve component.
//!
//! Some useful utilities are included too.  An internal crate is used to provide the `blueprint_stub` macro which
//! automates creating stub functions from a trait so calling another component is ergonomic.  Also included and
//! used for the `RatioBondingCurve` is a reusable arbitrary precision number implmentation that converts to/from Decimal
//! It is precise but not yet optimized.  Bounded (BigInt) or unbounded (BigRational) precision is configurable with a feature flag.
//!
//! # Bonuses:
//!
//! * This package is well tested (though not completely) with both unit and integration tests.  Integration
//! testing is not as easy as it should be, but using the [`scrypto-unit`] library helps a whole lot
//!
//! * Key portions of `BondingAMM` are implemented using [`scrypto_statictypes`] which provides compile-time resource
//! checking and additional runtime checking for enhanced producitivity and safety.
